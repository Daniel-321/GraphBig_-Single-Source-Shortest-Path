# GraphBig_-Single-Source-Shortest-Path
Verilog HDL_ Single Source Shortest Path (dijkstra's algorithm)

FPGA-based accerleration for SSSP(Single Source Shortest Path), using dijkstra's algorithm.
Based on <GraphBIG: Understanding Graph Computing in the Context of Industrial Solutions - Lifeng Nai...,SC'15>

1. For details, See FPGA Acceleration for Graph Application.pptx
2. Source codes are written in verilog HDL.
3. We use Vivado to commute with FPGA. Set-up is in PCIe_setup_DRAM_rev1.
